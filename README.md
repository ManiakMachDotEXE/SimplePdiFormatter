# SimplePdiFormatter

Simple macro-enabled excel sheet Which formats copy and pasted data for data entry. Mainly for use at work. 
I've been meaning to make an github account and this is just what I am working on at the moment. 
Any improvements are welcomed.

## Getting Started

No real mystery here. Just copy data into Cell B4 and run macro. It will copy the formatted data to E Column & the clipboard.
Ready for you to paste into CDK EXPERT POSTING.

## Deployment

As it stands this will only format the data so that it can be used in CDK Drive Dealer Management System. AGJE EXPERT ENTRY Function.
Which accepts copied data instead of manual posting and makes my life a whole lot easier. While it formats the data for EXPERT posting 
I've only set the macro to format 1 Type of entry data. PDI Statements. I plan to support other tedious posting.
